# SQL Training
In this project I will go through SQL exercises that I completed for my own development in data analysis and to build on my technical proficiency.
These projects covered:
  - Creating databases and inserting sample data to populate the fields
  - Using appropriate joins to combine tables together and build relationships in my dataset
  - Performing aggregations to select and view relevant data
